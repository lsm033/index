    <h1>BANG!</h1>
    <p>
      <br>I get up, I get down and I'm jumpin' around
      <br>And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
      <br>Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to grow
      <br>(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
      <br>So I got an apartment across from the park
      <br>Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feelin' grown
      <br>Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to go
      <br>(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
      <br>(Here we go)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>So put your best face on, everybody
      <br>Pretend you know this song, everybody
      <br>Come hang
      <br>Let's go out with a bang
      <br>(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
      <br>I'm way too young to lie here forever
      <br>I'm way too old to try, so whatever
      <br>Come hang
      <br>Let's go out with a bang
      <br>(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>Feel like I'm gonna puke 'cause my taxes are due
      <br>Do my password begin with a one or a two?
      <br>Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to grow
      <br>(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
      <br>(Metronome)
      <br>Man, I'm up to something (up to something), ooh-dee-la-dee-doh
